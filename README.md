Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a research scientist specializing in laser spectroscopy and chemometrics. Over the past few years, I have focused on advancing laser-based analytical instruments for rapid and accurate chemical analysis. I have authored over 20 publications in leading journals, including Spectrochimica Acta Part B: Atomic Spectroscopy, Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry, Optics Letters, and others.

ðŸ”¬ **What I Do**
-  **Laser Spectroscopy:** Innovating laser-based methods for spectrochemical analysis of materials.
-  **Spectroscopic Data Analysis:** Developing chemometric and machine learning models for accurate spectra interpretation and quantitative analysis.
-  **Software Development:** Building spectral data preprocessing and visualization tools.
