## Hello! I'm Christian L. Goueguel

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a research scientist specializing in laser spectroscopy and chemometrics. Over the past few years, I have focused on advancing laser-based analytical instruments to enable rapid and accurate chemical analysis. I have authored over 20 publications in leading journals, including Spectrochimica Acta Part B: Atomic Spectroscopy, Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry, Optics Letters, and others.

ðŸ”¬ **What I Do**
-  **Laser Spectroscopy:** Innovating methods for spectrochemical analysis of materials.
-  **Data Analysis:** Developing chemometric and machine learning models for accurate spectral interpretation and quantitative analysis.
-  **Software Development:** Building tools for spectroscopic data analysis and visualization.
