Hi there, and welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a research scientist with a passion for optics, laser spectroscopy, chemometrics/machine learning, and data science. In recent years I have been working on improving laser-based analytical instruments for rapid and accurate spectrochemical analysis. Along the way, I've also developed a few R packages for spectral data analysisâ€”feel free to check them out!

### Areas of Interest
-  **Laser Spectroscopy:** Innovating laser-based methods for spectrochemical analysis of materials.
-  **Spectroscopic Data Analysis:** Developing machine learning models for accurate spectroscopic data interpretation and quantitative analysis.
-  **Software Development:** Building spectral data preprocessing and visualization tools.
